Send commands via MQTT to a Tesla car using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)

If Home Assistant (HA) is already using the MQTT integration, then the various entities will be auto discovered by HA

## Installation and setup
TODO, but here's a start

- You must already have a working MQTT broker. If you want the entities to be auto discovered by Home Assistant (HA), then the HA MQTT Integration must already be set up and working. It is out of scope of this project to support the setup of this, it is well docuented elsewhere

## Credits

I got the idea for this from Raphael Murray as described here https://github.com/alandtse/tesla/issues/961#issuecomment-2150897886 

The technical method was derived from Shankar Kumarasamy's blog https://shankarkumarasamy.blog/2024/01/28/tesla-developer-api-guide-ble-key-pair-auth-and-vehicle-commands-part-3
